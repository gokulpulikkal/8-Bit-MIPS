# 8-bit Processor Implementation

This project implements, simulates, and synthesizes a simple 8-bit processor using Verilog and the Xilinx Vivado environment. The processor is tested both through software simulation and on actual hardware using a Xilinx FPGA board.
The processor is described in detail in the project documentation and is implemented using Verilog. Xilinx Vivado is used as the development environment to synthesize and simulate the design, and a Basys 3 FPGA board is used for hardware testing.

## Features

- 8-bit data width
- Basic arithmetic and logic operations
- Program counter and instruction register
- Simple instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Synthesizable to a Xilinx FPGA
